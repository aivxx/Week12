-- Challenges

   I ran across a few challenges with this VR Maze. First, I had trouble figuring out which XR Origin to use. After some troubleshooting, I learned that a few of them worked but only Device Based XR Origin gave me the L and R controllers.
Another challenge was the Oculus Plugin not working. I updated Unity from the 2020 version to the 2021 update and that worked at first. When I returned to my project a day later, it stopped working again. I watched a few YouTube videos
and was able to figure out the problem. I had toc reate a developer account for Oculus, run developer mode from my Oculus phone app, and switch Unity to Android. 
Finally, my last big challenge was getting the key to work and to show the win game message. The key kept falling through the gameobjects so I had to turn off gravity, so now the key stays in the air if the player drops it. As for the win message,
I forgot to set the render camera so it was not showing up when activated. Thankfully, all simple fixes.
